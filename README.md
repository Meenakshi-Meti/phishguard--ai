#  Overview

**PhishGuardAI** is an intelligent phishing detection platform designed to identify and prevent phishing attacks before users become victims. The application combines Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, behavioral analysis, phishing fingerprinting, and blockchain technology to detect both known and zero-day phishing attacks.

Unlike traditional phishing detection systems that rely mainly on blacklists, PhishGuardAI analyzes the behavior, content, visual appearance, and structure of suspicious resources to determine whether they are malicious.

The vision behind this project is to create a modern phishing detection ecosystem that continuously learns from new attacks while securely sharing threat intelligence through a decentralized ledger.

---

#  The Problem

Phishing remains one of the fastest-growing cyber threats worldwide. Every day, attackers create fake websites, fraudulent emails, counterfeit payment portals, and impersonated login pages to steal confidential information such as:

* Usernames and passwords
* Banking credentials
* Credit card information
* OTPs
* Personal identity data
* Corporate credentials

Traditional phishing detection methods have several limitations:

* Heavy dependence on blacklist databases
* Poor detection of newly created phishing domains
* High false-positive rates
* Slow community reporting
* Limited detection across different attack vectors

These limitations leave organizations and users vulnerable to sophisticated phishing campaigns.

---

#  Our Solution

PhishGuardAI approaches phishing detection differently.

Instead of simply asking whether a website already exists in a blacklist, the platform evaluates multiple characteristics to determine whether the content behaves like phishing.

The detection engine performs:

* URL analysis
* Email inspection
* Domain intelligence
* Visual similarity detection
* HTML structure comparison
* Risk scoring
* AI-based classification
* Blockchain signature verification

Each analysis contributes to a comprehensive threat assessment, allowing the platform to identify both existing and previously unseen phishing attempts.

---

#  Key Features

##  URL Scanner

Analyze suspicious URLs using multiple indicators, including:

* URL entropy
* Suspicious keywords
* Domain age
* SSL certificate validation
* Redirect chains
* WHOIS information
* DNS records
* Homograph attack detection

---

##  Email Scanner

Inspect emails for phishing indicators such as:

* SPF verification
* DKIM validation
* DMARC policy
* Suspicious sender addresses
* Embedded malicious links
* Urgency-based language
* AI-generated phishing patterns

---

##  QR Code Scanner

Extract hidden URLs from QR codes and perform:

* URL reputation analysis
* Redirect tracking
* SSL verification
* Domain intelligence lookup

---

##  File Scanner

Detect malicious content inside uploaded files.

Supported formats include:

* PDF
* DOCX
* Images
* ZIP archives

The scanner searches for:

* Embedded phishing URLs
* Hidden scripts
* Suspicious metadata
* Obfuscated content

---

##  AI Risk Assessment

Every scanned resource receives a confidence score based on multiple analysis engines.

Example:

```
Risk Score : 91%

Threat Level : High

Reasons:

• Newly registered domain
• Login page impersonation
• Suspicious HTML structure
• Brand similarity detected
```

---

##  Fingerprinting Engine

Instead of storing complete phishing pages, PhishGuardAI generates a unique digital fingerprint consisting of:

```
signature_id

├── text_hash
├── url_hash
├── visual_hash
└── struct_hash
```

This enables rapid identification of similar phishing attacks while minimizing storage requirements.

---

##  Blockchain Integration

Generated fingerprints are stored inside the **Global Phishing Signature Ledger (GPSL)**.

Benefits include:

* Immutable records
* Tamper-resistant storage
* Decentralized threat sharing
* Faster signature lookup
* Transparent verification
